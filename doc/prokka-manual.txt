Introduction
------------

Whole genome annotation is the process of identifying features of
interest in a set of genomic DNA sequences, and labelling them with
useful information. Prokka is a software tool to annotate bacterial,
archaeal and viral genomes quickly and produce standards-compliant
output files.

Installation
------------

Before the main install can begin you need to install some system
packages:

Centos/Fedora/RHEL (RPM)

``` {.bash}
sudo yum install perl-Time-Piece perl-XML-Simple perl-Digest-MD5 git java perl-CPAN perl-Module-Build
sudo cpan -i Bio::Perl  # if you don't have Bioperl installed (it will be tedious)
```

Ubuntu/Debian/Mint (APT)

``` {.bash}
sudo apt-get install libdatetime-perl libxml-simple-perl libdigest-md5-perl git default-jre bioperl
```

Mac OS X

``` {.bash}
sudo cpan Time::Piece XML::Simple Digest::MD5 Bio::Perl
```

There are currently 3 ways to install the main Prokka software: Github,
Tarball or Homebrew.

Github

Choose somewhere to put it, for example in your home directory (no root
access required):

``` {.bash}
% cd $HOME
```

Clone the latest version of the repository:

``` {.bash}
% git clone https://github.com/tseemann/prokka.git
% ls prokka
```

Index the sequence databases

``` {.bash}
% prokka/bin/prokka --setupdb
```

Homebrew

Homebrew is a package manager which allows users to easily install
complex software in their home directory. Instructions for installing it
are available for Linux and Mac OS X.

Ensure you have brew installed:

``` {.bash}
% brew
```

Make sure you have the homebrew-science tap/channel enabled:

``` {.bash}
% brew tap homebrew/science
% brew update
```

Install Prokka and all its dependencies:

``` {.bash}
% brew install prokka --HEAD
```

Tarball

WARNING: this method gives you very old version of prokka. The brew or
github methods are preferred!

Download the latest prokka-1.xx.tar.gz archive from
http://www.bioinformatics.net.au/software.prokka.shtml

``` {.bash}
% wget http://www.vicbioinformatics.com/prokka-1.11.tar.gz
```

Choose somewhere to put it, for example in your home directory (no root
access required):

``` {.bash}
% cd $HOME
% tar zxvf prokka-1.11.tar.gz
% ls prokka-1.11
```

Install dependencies

Prokka comes with many binaries for Linux and Mac OS X. It will always
use your existing installed versions if they exist, but will use the
included ones if that fails. For some older systems (eg. Centos 4.x)
some of them won't work due to them being dynamically linked against new
GLIBC libraries you don't have. You can consult the list of dependencies
later in this document.

Choose a rRNA predictor

Option 1 - Don't use one

If Prokka can't find a predictor for rRNA featues (either Barrnap or
RNAmmer below) then it simply won't annotate any. Most people don't care
that much about them anyway,

Option 2 - Barrnap

This was written by the author of Prokka and is recommended if you
prefer speed over absolute accuracy. It uses the new multi-core NHMMER
for DNA:DNA profile searches. Download it from
https://github.com/tseemann/barrnap

Option 3 - RNAmmer

RNAmmer was written when HMMER 2.x was the latest release. Since them,
HMMER 3.x has been released, and uses the same executable binary names.
Prokka needs HMMER3 and RNAmmer (and hence HMMER2) so you need to edit
your RNAmmer script to explicitly point your HMMER2 binary instead of
using the HMMER3 binary which is more likely to be in your PATH first.

Type which rnammer to find the script, and then edit it with your
favourite editor. Find the following lines at the top:

``` {.perl}
if ( $uname eq "Linux" ) {
#       $HMMSEARCH_BINARY = "/usr/cbs/bio/bin/linux64/hmmsearch";    # OLD
        $HMMSEARCH_BINARY = "/path/to/my/hmmer-2.3.2/bin/hmmsearch"; # NEW (yours)
}
```

If you are using Mac OS X, you'll also have to change the "Linux" to
"Darwin" too. As you can see, I have commented out the original part,
and replaced it with the location of my HMMER2 hmmsearch tool, so it
doesn't run the HMMER3 one. You need to ensure HMMER3 is in your PATH
before the old HMMER2 too.

Add to PATH

Add the following line to your $HOME/.bashrc file, or to
/etc/profile.d/prokka.sh to make it available to all users:

``` {.bash}
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/prokka-1.11/bin
```

Index the sequence databases

``` {.bash}
% prokka --setupdb
```

Test

-   Type prokka and it should output it's help screen.
-   Type prokka --version and you should see an output like prokka 1.x
-   Type prokka --listdb and it will show you what databases it has
    installed to use.

Output Files
------------

  Extension   Description
  ----------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  .gff        This is the master annotation in GFF3 format, containing both sequences and annotations. It can be viewed directly in Artemis or IGV.
  .gbk        This is a standard Genbank file derived from the master .gff. If the input to prokka was a multi-FASTA, then this will be a multi-Genbank, with one record for each sequence.
  .fna        Nucleotide FASTA file of the input contig sequences.
  .faa        Protein FASTA file of the translated CDS sequences.
  .ffn        Nucleotide FASTA file of all the prediction transcripts (CDS, rRNA, tRNA, tmRNA, misc_RNA)
  .sqn        An ASN1 format "Sequin" file for submission to Genbank. It needs to be edited to set the correct taxonomy, authors, related publication etc.
  .fsa        Nucleotide FASTA file of the input contig sequences, used by "tbl2asn" to create the .sqn file. It is mostly the same as the .fna file, but with extra Sequin tags in the sequence description lines.
  .tbl        Feature Table file, used by "tbl2asn" to create the .sqn file.
  .err        Unacceptable annotations - the NCBI discrepancy report.
  .log        Contains all the output that Prokka produced during its run. This is a record of what settings you used, even if the --quiet option was enabled.

Option: --rawproduct

Prokka annotates proteins by using sequence similarity to other proteins
in its database, or the databses the user provides via --proteins. By
default, Prokka tries to "cleans" the /product names to ensure they are
compliant with Genbank/ENA conventions. Some of the main things it does
is:

-   set vague names to hypothetical protein
-   consistifies terms like possible, probable, predicted, ... to
    putative
-   removes EC, COG and locus_tag identifiers

Full details can be found in the cleanup_product() function in the
prokka script. If you feel your annotations are being ruined, try using
the --rawproduct option, and please file an issue if you find an example
of where it is "behaving badly" and I will fix it.

Databases
---------

The Core (BLAST+) Databases

Prokka uses a variety of databases when trying to assign function to the
predicted CDS features. It takes a hierarchial approach to make it
fast.  
A small, core set of well characterized proteins are first searched
using BLAST+. This combination of small database and fast search
typically completes about 70% of the workload. Then a series of slower
but more sensitive HMM databases are searched using HMMER3.

The initial core databases are derived from UniProtKB; there is one per
"kingdom" supported. To qualify for inclusion, a protein must be (1)
from Bacteria (or Archaea or Viruses); (2) not be "Fragment" entries;
and (3) have an evidence level ("PE") of 2 or lower, which corresponds
to experimental mRNA or proteomics evidence.

Making a Core Databases

If you want to modify these core databases, the included script
prokka-uniprot_to_fasta_db, along with the official uniprot_sprot.dat,
can be used to generate a new database to put in
/opt/prokka/db/kingdom/. If you add new ones, the command
prokka --listdb will show you whether it has been detected properly.

The Genus Databases

If you enable --usegenus and also provide a Genus via --genus then it
will first use a BLAST database which is Genus specific. Prokka comes
with a set of databases for the most common Bacterial genera; type
prokka --listdb to see what they are.

Adding a Genus Databases

If you have a set of Genbank files and want to create a new Genus
database, Prokka comes with a tool called prokka-genbank_to_fasta_db to
help. For example, if you had four annotated "Coccus" genomes, you could
do the following:

    % prokka-genbank_to_fasta_db Coccus1.gbk Coccus2.gbk Coccus3.gbk Coccus4.gbk > Coccus.faa
    % cd-hit -i Coccus.faa -o Coccus -T 0 -M 0 -g 1 -s 0.8 -c 0.9
    % rm -fv Coccus.faa Coccus.bak.clstr Coccus.clstr
    % makeblastdb -dbtype prot -in Coccus
    % mv Coccus.p* /path/to/prokka/db/genus/

The HMM Databases

Prokka comes with a bunch of HMM libraries for HMMER3. They are mostly
Bacteria-specific. They are searched after the core and genus databases.
You can add more simply by putting them in /opt/prokka/db/hmm. Type
prokka --listdb to confirm they are recognised.

FASTA database format

Prokka understands two annotation tag formats, a plain one and a
detailed one.

The plain one is a standard FASTA-like line with the ID after the >
sign, and the protein /product after the ID (the "description" part of
the line):

    >SeqID product

The detailed one consists of a special encoded three-part description
line. The parts are the /EC_number, the /gene code, then the /product -
and they are separated by a special "~" sequence:

    >SeqID EC_number~~~gene~~~product

Here are some examples. Note that not all parts need to be present, but
the "~" should still be there:

    >YP_492693.1 2.1.1.48~~~ermC~~~rRNA adenine N-6-methyltransferase
    MNEKNIKHSQNFITSKHNIDKIMTNIRLNEHDNIFEIGSGKGHFTLELVQRCNFVTAIEI

"DESC" fields are used:

    ACC   PRK00001

FAQ
---

-   Where does the name "Prokka" come from?  
    Prokka is a contraction of "prokaryotic annotation". It's also
    relatively unique within Google, and also rhymes with a native
    Australian marsupial called the quokka.

-   Can I annotate by eukaryote genome with Prokka?  
    No. Prokka is specifically designed for Bacteria, Archaea and
    Viruses. It can't handle multi-exon gene models; I would recommend
    using MAKER 2 for that purpose.

-   Why does Prokka keeps on crashing when it gets to tge "tbl2asn"
    stage?  
    It seems that the tbl2asn program from NCBI "expires" after 12
    months, and refuses to run. Unfortunately you need to install a
    newer version which you can download from here.

-   The hmmscan step seems to hang and do nothing?  
    The problem here is GNU Parallel. It seems the Debian package for
    hmmer has modified it to require the --gnu option to behave in the
    'default' way. There is no clear reason for this. The only way to
    restore normal behaviour is to edit the prokka script and change
    parallel to parallel --gnu.

-   Why does prokka fail when it gets to hmmscan?  
    Unfortunately HMMER keeps changing it's database format, and they
    aren't upward compatible. If you upgraded HMMER (from 3.0 to 3.1
    say) then you need to "re-press" the files. This can be done as
    follows: cd /path/to/prokka/db/hmm mkdir new for D in .hmm ; do
    hmmconvert D > new/D ; done cd new for D in .hmm ; do hmmpress $D ;
    done mv * .. rmdir new

-   Why does Prokka take so long to download?  
    Our server is in Australia, and the international pipes aren't
    always flowing as well as we'd like. I try to put it on GoogleDrive.
    Dropbox is no longer possible due to bandwidth quotas. If you are
    able to mirror Prokka (~2 GB) outside please let me know.

-   Why can't I load Prokka .GBK files into Mauve?  
    Mauve uses BioJava to parse GenBank files, and it is very picky
    about Genbank files. It does not like long contig names, like those
    from Velvet or Spades. One solution is to use --centre XXX in Prokka
    and it will rename all your contigs to be NCBI (and Mauve)
    compliant. It does not like the ACCESSION and VERSION strings that
    Prokka produces via the "tbl2asn" tool. The following Unix command
    will fix them:
    egrep -v '^(ACCESSION|VERSION)' prokka.gbk > mauve.gbk
